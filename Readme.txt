1. make sure that the non Github Version has been uninstalled.
2. Change the Path of the MEGreatWar.mod file to your systems mod folder, currently its set to mine. the file also needs to be in the mod folder itself and not in this current subfolder.
3. the mod should show up in the paradox launcher as a mod without an image, then its the right one
4. activate debug mode for Hoi IV by going into the properties view in steam and writing -debug into the launch options
5. Everything should work now, otherwise notify me on discord, have fun --Bacegun-- <3
